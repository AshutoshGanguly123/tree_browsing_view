# tree_browsing_view
A simple tool to browse webpages in breadth-first manner. 
Browsing on wikipedia can get you into rabbit holes. A tool which takes in an input wikipedia link and generates a graph where edges represent connection and nodes represent the hyperlinks can be ueful.
This is also useful to mine information which is similar to a given input, for training models trying to find similarity or building repesentation of some information.

For playing with this code, just change the link and depth variable according to your needs. : )
